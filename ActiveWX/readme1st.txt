To get you started there are two Active Weather 98 files in the
Active Weather 98/Weather directory.  These files contain a number of
Southern California stations.  The first file socal.acw just contains the stations.  The second file, socal_wx.acw contains the station and its weather conditions.

Each of these file are meant as a starting point.  I created these
utilizing active weather 98.  To fly the actual wx in southern Cal at this moment  do the following;

1. Load the stations only file socal.acw.
2. Download the weather for one or all of the stations to a hard disk file or directly from a URL/CGI.  I provided on to the National weather service Metar page in the CGI area.  (Change the text value1 field to the stations you need IF YOU UTILIZE MY PROVIDE URL/CGI)  Once the file is downloaded press the process wx button and it will update the station(s) with the current wx.  If you download a file to  
disk or directly to Active Wx with every station selected, then they will all be updated when you press process weather.

3. Create the adventure for Flight Simulator by pressing the Make ADV button.

4. Start FS and open the adventure you created.  Be sure to fill in the title and description in the adventure options screen.  You will look for this title in the adventure titles in FS.
